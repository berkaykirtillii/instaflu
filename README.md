# instaflu

It was created using python with flask frame work and selenium library.

Instaflu is a web application where users can control their followers. It tells you the usernames of the users you follow but they don't follow.
Applications that perform this process usually run by requesting a username and password.It is not appropriate to enter your password for security reasons.
You can find out just by entering your username. If your account is not private account, you do not need to take any further action.
You should wait to find your unfollowers. If your account is private account, instaflu sends a follow request and you should to accept this request. 
After these actions, you will find unfollowers.
